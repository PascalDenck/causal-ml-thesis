# Implementing Causal Machine Learning in Manufacturing

This project focuses on implementing causal machine learning in a real manufacturing environment. Specifically, it aims to identify causal relationships between machine features within a CNC milling dataset. The dataset includes two key dependent variables: power consumption and processing time. The primary objective is to measure the causal effect of various machine features on these prediction variables.
